* Go Generics support
* conditions support
* callbacks support

## Usage

See [`examples`](./examples) directory for more details:

* [`basic.go`](./examples/basic.go) - basic usage with transitions
* [`condition.go`](./examples/condition.go) - usage with transition with condition
* [`handler.go`](./examples/handler.go) - usage with handler adapter
* [`state_monitor.go`](./examples/state_monitor.go) - usage with state monitor

Or you can run all of them by:
